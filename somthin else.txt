To install globally, just run this from the project folder:

powershell
cd c:\Users\Musab\Desktop\ai-router-cli
npm install -g .
After that, you can run zaycode from anywhere — any folder, any terminal.

If you transfer the files to another machine, the steps are:

Copy the entire ai-router-cli folder (but you can skip node_modules/)
On the new machine, open the folder and run:
powershell
npm install
npm install -g .
Make sure the 

.env
 file has your OPENROUTER_API_KEY:
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here
Then just type zaycode from anywhere
To uninstall later:

powershell
npm uninstall -g zaycode
